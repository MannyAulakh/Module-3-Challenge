# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

The following challenge involved primarily working with Javascript to create a password generator. Only the tools learned so far in the course were implemented. The following page allows the user to generate a password from 8 to 128 characters long with options to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and/or special characters. To operate the application the user will click on “generate password” and follow a series of prompts. The password will appear on the page.

-	The user must click OK at least once to either include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
-	The user must enter a number greater than 8 and less than 128
-	Password is validated to ensure it complies with user's criteria
